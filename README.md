## MERN(Mongo Express React Node)
프론트엔드는 React의 클래스형 컴포넌트를 사용하였으며, 서버는 NodeJS용 Framework인 ExpressJS, DB는 MongoDB를 사용하여 Todo-List를 구현하였습니다.

컴포넌트 스타일링은 material-ui를 사용하였고 Router로 홈화면, Todo-List, Write New Todo, Edit Todo 페이지로 이동 할 수 있도록 구현하였습니다.


Clone후 실행이 되지 않는 경우

NodeJS download

yarn download

MongoDB download



$ yarn add react-router-dom

$ npm install express body-parser cors mongoose

$ npm install -g nodemon

$ yarn add axios

$ yarn add @material-ui/core



위의 라이브러리를 install합니다.

그리고 클라이언트서버, 백엔드서버, MongoDB를 start합니다.

$ yarn start

$ nodemon server.js

$ mongo

$ use todos


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
